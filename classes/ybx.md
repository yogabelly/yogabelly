YBX is a fusion style yoga class that combines the physicality of a yoga class with the influence and style of other forms of physical training. Each class varies in style and influence based on the instructor and his/her experiences. 

YBX is challenging, intense, and super fun! Please check out the assigned teacher's bio for details on what he/she brings to his/her YBX class.
