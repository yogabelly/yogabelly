Yoga Tune Up&reg; is a challenging but accessible practice that incorporates movements from classical yoga, corrective exercise and self-massage that explores every micro-region of your body's anatomy; systematically and intelligently priming your body, mind and spirit. Its restorative techniques create balance and flexibility in the body, while relieving painful injuries, improving coordination, and reducing stress. Yoga Tune Up® brings a practical yoga philosophy into the nuts and bolts of healthy movement, challenging the body from every conceivable angle until breakthroughs occur - literally changing the nature of the tissues in the area being addressed.
