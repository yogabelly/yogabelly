Yoga Belly is our "core-centric" class where we focus on isolation and work primarily with key core muscles. This dynamic core class also includes foundations of flow (breathing through movement) in a heated room to loosen & relax your muscles. The Yoga Belly sequence moves from floor work to standing poses, then balancing to seated poses, and beyond. When practiced regularly, Yoga Belly will help tone, tighten, and strengthen your core as well as help you develop a powerful yoga practice. This class is great for beginners, and all levels are welcome!
