Check out these testimonials...

Susan Holland, Fitness & Yoga: It's a beautiful space in a great location. The staff are incredibly kind and welcoming. My workshop sold out and I could have hosted another sold out workshop with everyone on the waitlist. People told me they loved the Thai Massage workshop. They felt relaxed, cared for and are excited to do more workshops with me at Yoga Belly.

Christine Oakes, Fun2BeFit: Holding the workshop at the studio was a great experience! It provided all of the equipment (blocks, straps, sound equipment, and heat) that was needed to hold a fun class. We had a soldout class so I would say the turnout was better than expected. After, everyone was able to go out and play in downtown Mountain View due to the convenience of the location.

Leslie Van Schaak, Acro Yoga Teacher: Great space! Lighting options great to achieve the right ambiance. And of course the disco ball ROCKS and takes the class to a whole new level! Also appreciate great heating options and sound quality. 

Adam Sewell, Yoga Teacher: My turnout included Yoga Belly students and students from a couple of other studios. I received great feedback on my workshop and
many of the students really liked the location and the venue.
