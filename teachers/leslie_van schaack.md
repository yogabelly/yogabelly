Leslie discovered yoga many years ago as a gym rat looking for a good workout. Enjoying the practice and sharing the lessons and blessings of this practice have truly become Leslie's life's passion and mission. She aspires to share the practice and give you an amazing fully body workout and make your body stronger. Yoga's true gift is what it offers your mind, your spirit, and your relationships. Leslie believes yoga is a rich metaphor for life, learning to breathe and work through the challenging poses on the mat that can make you more resilient and mindful at facing the challenges off the mat.
