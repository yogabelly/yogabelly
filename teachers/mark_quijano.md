Mark is a very outgoing and energetic person who loves things that get him moving both indoors and outdoors: cycling, hiking, running, scuba diving, swimming, and anything beach related, to name a few activities. A software engineer by trade, Mark discovered yoga a few years back as a way to help him manage his stress and and to keep him active during the rainy winter months. He quickly fell in love with practice and not too long after decided to take a leap and take teacher training. Completing his Power Yoga Teacher Training, Mark is very alignment focused in his teaching, loves coming up with fun and interesting transitions, and ways to further deepening his inversion practice. His personal practice usually takes the form or Power or Vinyasa Flow during the morning and a nice restorative Yin practice before bed. He embraces all types of yoga and loves trying new styles out.

Mark also is a big dog lover, foodie, and wine-o.
