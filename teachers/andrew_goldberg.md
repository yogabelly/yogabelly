Andrew first attended Yoga Belly on a dare to venture outside his comfort zone in the gym. He was so impressed by the quality of workout and community engagement that within a month he joined the check-in crew and within a year completed Yoga Belly's teacher apprenticeship program.

Andrew brings to his class a diversity of experience. He has finished his doctorate degree in clinical psychology with a focus on mindfulness and stress reduction. Andrews background makes his classes rhythmic, psychically elevating and physically challenging. His instruction provides students the opportunity to identify their boundaries and extend them a little farther. Most importantly, students are encouraged to have fun and hopefully take their practice off the mat and out into their daily lives.
