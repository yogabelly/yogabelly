Looking for a way to cross train with ballet, Alyse discovered yoga in her first ever Vinyasa yoga class at Yoga Belly. Yoga became an instant passion that enhanced the quality of her dancing and sparked her meditation journey. She fell in love with Yoga Bellyâ€™s good vibes and joined the check-in team to spend more time with the YB community. Eager to learn, she jumped into her 200hr training in SF in June 2016 followed by Yoga Belly's teacher training immediately after in July 2016 and now she is in the midst of working toward her 500-hour yoga teacher training certification. 

Alyse graduated with a B.F.A. in Dance from UCSB and now dances professionally and teaches dance. Whether in ballet or yoga, she loves to challenge herself and her students to flow with grace and awareness even in the hardest of transitions.
