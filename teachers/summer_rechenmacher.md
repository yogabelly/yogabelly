Summer Rechenmacher is a RYT 200 Hour Yoga Alliance Certified Instructor and an NASM Certified Personal Trainer. She lives with her family in Northern California and brings yoga and fitness to her friends, family and community at large. Fitness is Summer’s passion and has been a part of her life for as long as she can remember. It all began years ago in the 80’s, when she attended aerobics classes taught by her mom. She came to her her first yoga class 16 years ago to mix up her workouts and what followed was a wonderful transformation. As Summer gained the strength and confidence to perform challenging poses and arm balances that once seemed so daunting she gained more than she could have ever imagined. She soon realized that, not only did yoga enrich her physical health, but also helped her grow mentally and emotionally. She wanted to share the joy and therapeutic benefits that she personally experienced with others, so she completed the 70-hour Yoga Belly Teacher Apprenticeship Program, and began her journey into learning how to inspire and empower others through yoga. Summer furthered her education and completed her 200-Hour Yoga Certification.

Summer encourages her students to break out of their comfort zone and grow, to realize their full potential, both on and off the mat. Summer's dynamic, flow-based classes are athletically challenging, yet playful and fun! She emphasizes connecting the breath with each movement and teaches her students to listen to their bodies so they move with self-awareness through their practice. She also tries to inspire her students to maintain the spacious, uplifted mood when leaving the class to bring awareness of the benefits of yoga to others in their own lives.
