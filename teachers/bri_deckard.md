Bri started yoga as a way to improve her strength and flexibility. As she continued her practice, she realized that yoga is the art of getting back to the true you. Through unity of body, mind and breath the practice of yoga helps the practitioner to wake up and start living the present moment. She approaches yoga with a sense of curiosity and playfulness, and enjoys sharing that same sense of fun and exploration with her students. Our journeys are meant to be shared, and in her classes you will feel a strong sense of community as we move, breath and laugh with one another. Bri is completing her 200-hour Yoga Teacher Training with Yoga Belly in November 2015. She invites you to come and embrace both individuality and unity in her classes.
