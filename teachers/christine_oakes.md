Christine first discovered yoga when one of her personal training clients invited her to a class at Yoga Belly.  Having always been attracted to your typical gym workout, she was somewhat skeptical as to what yoga could offer.  After her first class she was hooked.  As she continued to practice,  Christine discovered the many benefits of yoga that translated beyond the mat to improve her strength, self-confidence & reduce everyday stress. Through yoga she began to explore & discover the playfulness of yoga.

As a full-time personal trainer & yoga instructor, she started to fuse both yoga & personal training into her teachings.  Christine completed the 200 hour teacher training program with Yoga Source in Los Gatos under Linda McGrath as well as the 70 Hour teacher training program with Yoga Belly under William Cristobal & Aaron Goodnow. It is Christine’s intention for students to be able to challenge themselves safely during class while having fun.  Her classes are a place where you can feel comfortable to just relax, be yourself & laugh often.  The gift of yoga is something that she will always be grateful for & hopes to extend these same joys to her students on & off the mat.
