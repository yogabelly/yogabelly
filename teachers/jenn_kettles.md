Jenn had her first experience with yoga in 2006 when they started offering lunchtime classes at her office.  After 10 years of growing her own personal practice, she pursued and earned her RYT200 from Yoga Belly and is so thankful to all of her teachers along the way for their patience and constant encouragement. Jenn hopes to be a similar inspiration to her students and wants everybody, no matter their experience level, to leave her classes feeling empowered in their practice and to stay motivated to keep coming back to their mat.  Jenn's  ​has an  energetic ​ and​   ​playful teaching style  and  ​she promises you'll  hear at least one Prince song on every playlist.​
