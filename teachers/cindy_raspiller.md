Cindy started practicing yoga regularly at Yoga Belly Studio in early 2013, and was hooked after 3 classes. What began as a quest to “just get some exercise” turned into a passion for her practice. After seeing great improvements in her physical and mental strength and flexibility, she decided to learn more about yoga and its effects on the body and mind and completed Yoga Belly’s 200-Hour Teacher Training program in 2016.

Off the mat, Cindy works as a graphic designer. She strives to bring some of the same skills required of her day-job into her teaching: creativity, structure, and an ability to break complex ideas down into their basic parts. Above all, she wants her students to move their bodies in new and interesting ways and leave class feeling strong and self-assured. 

Also, Cindy will gladly geek out with you about beer, design, or yoga anytime.
