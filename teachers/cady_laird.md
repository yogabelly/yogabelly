Cady got hooked on yoga when she first started her practice in 2007. She became a certified teacher in 2010 at the Mount Madonna Center in Classical Ashtanga. While living in Thailand for one year, she studied and taught yoga, Reiki, and Traditional Thai massage. Cadyâ€™s classes, as well as her personal practice, are Vinyasa-inspired. Her classes are challenging and fun, suitable for multiple levels, with cool music, and hands-on adjustments. Her favorite teachers include Nathan Johnson, Philip Urso, Terileigh Schmidt, and Will Cristobal.
